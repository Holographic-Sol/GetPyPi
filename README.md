project not updated for years and outdated. see getpypi2

GetPyPi:
  A mass package downloader. This program crawls pypi.python.org for available packages and saves them to a user specified directory.
  Only packages hosted by pypi.python.org will be downloaded as crawling outside pypi.python.org domain will take too much of my time.

Req: Python 3.5.2
